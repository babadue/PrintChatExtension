# <div align="center">Print Chat Conversation Browser Extension</div>

## Description:

On occasions, I want to print out an entire chat conversation with an LLM AI.
Unfortunately, neither Windows browsers nor macOS/iOS Safari have this featureâ€” they only allow printing a single page.

This browser extension solves that problem by enabling full conversation printing. However, the output may vary depending on the chat website. Some unwanted artifacts might still appear.

## Purposes:

A simple Windows Edge/Chrome browser extension to print the entire chat conversation.
